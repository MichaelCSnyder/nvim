# Neovim Config
> [!WARNING]
> Use ```:Lazy restore``` (or the equivalent command in the ```:Lazy``` gui) to restore plugins to the state in lazy-lock.json to prevent updates causing breaking changes.
> If you wish to update a specific plugin, you can do so with ```:Lazy update [plugin-name.nvim]```.
> For the same reason, avoid blindly updating mason language servers unless prepared to update configurations.

### Helpful Tips
- Run ```:Lazy``` to enter the Lazy UI for managing plugins
- Run ```:Mason``` to enter the Mason UI for installing LSPs, DAPs, Formatters, etc.
- Run ```:LspInfo``` to inspect installed LSPs, which are active, and the buffers on which they are attached
